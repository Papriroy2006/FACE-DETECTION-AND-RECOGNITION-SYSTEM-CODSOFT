Here's a step-by-step breakdown without code:

1. Import the necessary libraries: OpenCV (`cv2`) for image processing and face_recognition for face detection and recognition.

2. Define the path to the image file you want to process.

3. Load the image using OpenCV's `imread` function.

4. Initialize lists to store face encodings and corresponding names.

5. Set screen dimensions for display if needed.

6. Convert the loaded image from BGR to RGB format, which is required for face recognition.

7. Use the `face_recognition` library to detect faces in the image using the `face_locations` function.

8. Compute face encodings using the detected face locations with the `face_encodings` function.

9. Iterate over each detected face:

   - Draw a rectangle around the detected face using OpenCV's `rectangle` function.
   
   - Compare the detected face encoding with known face encodings stored in the `encodings` list using `compare_faces` function.
   
   - If a match is found, retrieve the corresponding name from the `names` list.
   
   - Display the name near the detected face using OpenCV's `putText` function.

10. Display the processed image with rectangles around faces and recognized names using OpenCV's `imshow` function.

11. Wait for a key press to close the window using `waitKey` and then close the window using `destroyAllWindows`.
