This code is a combination of two separate functionalities: a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent and a face detection and recognition system using the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries. Let's break down each part separately:

1. **Tic Tac Toe Game**:
   - The code defines classes for the game, board, and AI.
   - It utilizes the Pygame library for graphics and user input handling.
   - The `Board` class manages the game board, checks for wins, marks squares, etc.
   - The `AI` class implements AI opponents with different levels of difficulty (random or using the minimax algorithm).
   - The `Game` class orchestrates the game flow, handling player turns, checking for game over conditions, and resetting the game.

2. **Face Detection and Recognition**:
   - This part of the code utilizes the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries.
   - It loads an image file, detects faces, and compares them against known face encodings.
   - Known face encodings and corresponding names are stored in lists (`encodings` and `names`).
   - Detected faces are surrounded by rectangles, and if a match is found, the name associated with the matching encoding is displayed near the face.

3. **Integration**:
   - The two functionalities are presented in a single code snippet, but they operate independently.
   - The Tic Tac Toe game logic runs within a Pygame loop, while the face detection and recognition part is executed using OpenCV's image processing capabilities.

4. **Execution**:
   - The main loop handles user input events for the Tic Tac Toe game (such as mouse clicks and key presses).
   - The face detection and recognition part is executed after the Tic Tac Toe loop.

5. **Display**:
   - The processed image with face detection and recognition results is displayed in a window using OpenCV's `cv2.imshow()` function.

Overall, this code snippet demonstrates how to implement two distinct functionalities using different libraries and integrate them within a Python script.
